# API Doc Generator

Generate or validate API documentation by scanning source code. Currently optimized for Go (with Fiber, Echo, Chi, Gin support). The output is a multi-file directory structure — one Markdown file per endpoint, grouped by handler domain — so each API is easy to find, review, and maintain independently.

## Output Structure

```
docs/api/
├── index.md              ← service header, overview, endpoints table, common errors
├── <group>/
│   ├── <endpoint>.md     ← one endpoint per file
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

- **Grouping:** each subdirectory under the handler base directory = one group
- **File naming:** handler function name converted to kebab-case (e.g., `AcceptConsent` → `accept-consent.md`)
- **Path params in docs:** always use `{param}` format in documented paths, regardless of framework syntax in code (`:id` → `{id}`, `{id}` stays `{id}`)
- **Index:** `docs/api/index.md` links to every endpoint file

## Modes

| Mode | When to use | What it does |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Generate** | No `docs/api/` directory exists, or user wants to regenerate from scratch | Scan code → create `docs/api/` with `index.md` + group folders + per-endpoint files |
| **Update** | `docs/api/index.md` exists, code has changed | Scan code → diff against existing files → add/update/remove individual endpoint files + regenerate `index.md` |
| **Validate** | User wants to check consistency | Compare all files in `docs/api/` vs code → report per-file discrepancies without modifying |

Detect the mode automatically:
1. If `docs/api/index.md` doesn't exist → **Generate**
2. If user says "validate", "check", "เช็ค" → **Validate**
3. Otherwise → **Update**

If a legacy `docs/api-doc.md` exists but no `docs/api/` directory, treat as **Generate** (migration from old single-file format).

The user can override by specifying the mode explicitly.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Read Project Context

Read `CLAUDE.md` (or `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`) to understand:
- Project name and purpose (for the doc header)
- Framework used (Fiber, Echo, Chi, Gin)
- Project structure conventions
- API versioning pattern (e.g., `/api/v1/`)

If no convention file exists, infer from the code structure.

### Step 1: Discover Routes

Scan the codebase for route registration patterns. Read [`references/go-scan-patterns.md`](references/go-scan-patterns.md) for framework-specific patterns.

**What to find:**
- All registered routes (method + path)
- The handler function each route maps to
- Route groups and prefixes
- Middleware applied (auth, validation)

**Where to look (in order):**
1. Router setup file — often `cmd/api/main.go`, `internal/router.go`, or `routes.go`
2. Route group files — `internal/<domain>/routes.go`
3. Handler files — `internal/<domain>/handler/*.go`

### Step 1b: Discover Handler Groups

After finding routes, scan the handler directory structure to determine grouping. Read [`references/go-scan-patterns.md`](references/go-scan-patterns.md) § Handler Directory Scanning for detailed patterns.

1. **Locate handler base directory** — typically `internal/delivery/http/handler/` or `internal/handler/`
2. **List subdirectories** — each subdirectory = one group (e.g., `handler/consent/` → group "consent")
3. **Map handler files to endpoints** — each Go file (excluding `handler.go`, `request.go`, `response.go`, `dto.go`, `*_test.go`) maps to one endpoint doc file
4. **Extract function name** — find the exported receiver method in each file, convert PascalCase to kebab-case for the filename
5. **Build group map** — `{ group: "consent", endpoints: [{ function: "AcceptConsent", file: "accept-consent.md", method: "POST", path: "/api/v1/consents" }, ...] }`

If the handler directory has no subdirectories (flat structure), fall back to grouping by route prefix.

### Step 2: Extract Endpoint Details

For each discovered route, trace from handler → usecase → repository to extract:

1. **Request shape** — handler's request struct (path params, query params, request body)
2. **Response shape** — handler's response struct (success and error cases), including any response wrapper
3. **Success status code** — check the handler's success return to determine the actual HTTP status (200/201/204/etc.), do not guess
4. **Business logic** — open and read ALL usecase methods called by the handler. Walk through the entire happy-path flow line by line and write one numbered step per distinct action. Every `if` check, every repo/service call, every side effect (notification, event publish, cache invalidation) must appear as a step. Do not summarize multiple actions into one step — if the usecase does 8 things, the doc must have 8 steps. Include validation rules, conditional branches, and what happens on success.
5. **Error responses** — mapped HTTP status codes from error handling

Track which group each endpoint belongs to — this determines its file placement in Step 3.

**Where to find these:**
- Request/Response structs: `handler/request.go`, `handler/response.go`, or inline in handler files
- Response wrapper: check how handler returns data — may wrap in `Response{Success, Data, Message}` (see `go-scan-patterns.md` § Response Wrapper Detection)
- Domain entities: `entity.go` in the domain package (handler may return entity directly if no response struct exists)
- Query params: both struct-based AND inline `c.Query()` calls in handler (see `go-scan-patterns.md` § Query Parameters from Handler Code)
- Success status code: check the handler's `c.JSON(statusCode, ...)` or `c.Status(code).JSON(...)` — do not assume 200
- Error mapping: handler's error-to-status-code logic
- Auth type: determined from middleware on the route group — check for JWT/Bearer middleware, API key middleware, or no auth. Document as `Bearer token`, `API Key`, or `None` in the endpoint header
- Validation rules: request struct tags (`validate:"required"`, `binding:"required"`), usecase validation

#### Field Completeness — Every Field Matters

The doc must be a 1:1 mirror of the code structs. A missing field or wrong type makes the doc unreliable and defeats its purpose. Follow these rules:

1. **Read the full struct** — open the actual `.go` file containing the struct and read every field. Do not rely on memory or partial scans. Count only serializable fields (exclude `json:"-"` and unexported fields) — if a struct has 20 serializable fields, the doc must have 20 rows.
2. **Follow embedded/composed structs** — if a struct embeds another (`BaseResponse`, `Pagination`, `Timestamps`), read that parent struct too and include all its fields in the doc table.
3. **Resolve custom types** — if a field uses a custom type (e.g., `ConsentStatus`, `NullString`, `decimal.Decimal`), trace its definition and document the underlying type + allowed values in the Remark column.
4. **Pointer and omitempty fields** — `*string` or `json:",omitempty"` means the field is optional and can be `null`. Mark as `O` and show `null` in Example when appropriate.
5. **Nested objects and arrays** — if a field is a struct or slice-of-struct, create a separate sub-table for that object type. The parent table Remark column should say `See <Name> Object below`.
6. **Cross-check after writing** — after writing the field table, re-read the source struct and compare line by line. Every serializable field (exclude `json:"-"` and unexported fields) must have a matching row in the table.

Read [`references/go-scan-patterns.md`](references/go-scan-patterns.md) § Field Extraction Completeness for detailed patterns on embedded structs, custom types, and edge cases.

#### Error Response Completeness — Every Error Path Matters

A partial error table gives false confidence. Use a **usecase-first** approach — the usecase layer is the source of truth for business errors. Then supplement with handler-level errors.

1. **Open and read ALL usecase methods** — this is the most important step. Read the handler to find every usecase/service call it makes — some handlers call multiple usecase methods (e.g., `h.purposeUsecase.GetByID(...)` then `h.consentUsecase.Create(...)`). For each usecase method called, open the file and read the entire function body. List every distinct error it can return: named sentinel errors (`ErrNotFound`, `ErrDuplicate`), wrapped errors (`fmt.Errorf(...)`), and errors from repository/external calls. Each one becomes a candidate error response row.
2. **Trace usecase errors to HTTP status** — for each error found in step 1 (across all usecase methods), go back to the handler and find how it maps that error to an HTTP status code (via `errors.Is` switch, error type assertion, or error map). This gives you the Status + Error Message for the doc.
3. **Handler-level errors** — scan the handler function itself for direct non-2xx returns that happen *before* calling the usecase: bind/parse errors (400), validation errors (422), auth middleware rejections (401/403), path param parsing errors (400).
4. **Sentinel error discovery** — search for `var Err... = errors.New(...)` in the domain/entity package. Cross-reference with all the usecase methods to confirm which ones this endpoint can actually trigger.
5. **Default/fallback case** — always include the catch-all error (usually 500 Internal Server Error) that handles unexpected errors.
6. **Cross-check after writing** — re-read ALL usecase methods AND the handler's error mapping. Count error returns across all usecase methods + direct error returns in the handler → must match the rows in the error table.

Read [`references/go-scan-patterns.md`](references/go-scan-patterns.md) § Error Tracing Patterns for comprehensive patterns on how errors flow through layers.

### Step 3: Generate, Update, or Validate

Read [`references/api-doc-template.md`](references/api-doc-template.md) for the exact output format (Index Template + Per-Endpoint Template).

#### Generate Mode

Create the `docs/api/` directory structure:

1. **Create `docs/api/index.md`** using the Index Template:
   - Service name, version, base URL
   - Overview paragraph
   - Endpoints table per group — each row links to the per-endpoint file
   - Common error responses section

2. **Create group directories** — `docs/api/<group>/` for each handler group

3. **Create per-endpoint files** — `docs/api/<group>/<endpoint-name>.md` using the Per-Endpoint Template:
   - Breadcrumb navigation back to index
   - One endpoint only: method, path, auth, params, request/response, business logic, errors
   - Use `H1` for the endpoint name (it's the top-level heading in its own file)
   - Use `H2` for sub-sections (Path Parameters, Request Body, etc.)

#### Update Mode

1. Read existing `docs/api/index.md` and all group directories
2. Build a map of existing documented endpoints (file path → endpoint)
3. Scan code to get current endpoints (same as Generate)
4. Diff and apply changes:
   - **New endpoints** → create new `.md` file in the appropriate group directory
   - **Removed endpoints** → delete the orphaned `.md` file; if group directory is empty, remove it
   - **Changed endpoints** → update only the changed file
   - **Group changes** → if a handler moved to a different group directory, move the doc file
5. Regenerate `docs/api/index.md` to reflect current state
6. Preserve any manually-added notes in endpoint files that aren't auto-generated

#### Validate Mode

Compare all files in `docs/api/` against discovered routes **at the same depth as Step 2** — open the actual struct files and ALL usecase methods, not just check surface-level presence.

Run **every item** in the [Verification Checklist](references/api-doc-template.md#verification-checklist). Then produce a report:

```
## API Doc Validation Report

**Status:** [In Sync / Out of Sync]
**Checked:** [timestamp]
**Structure:** docs/api/ with [N] groups, [M] endpoint files

### Missing Files (endpoints in code but no doc file)
- POST /api/v1/consents → expected at docs/api/consent/accept-consent.md
  handler: AcceptConsent (internal/delivery/http/handler/consent/accept_consent.go:12)

### Orphan Files (doc files with no matching endpoint in code)
- docs/api/consent/delete-consent.md → no matching route found

### Field Mismatches (per file)
Check performed: opened struct source file, counted serializable fields vs doc rows.
- docs/api/consent/get-consent.md
  - Response: struct has 8 fields, doc has 6 rows — MISSING: `revoked_at`, `revoked_by`
  - Response: `status` documented as String, code uses `ConsentStatus` (enum: "active", "revoked", "expired")
  - Request: embedded `BaseRequest` has 2 fields not in doc: `request_id`, `trace_id`

### Error Response Mismatches (per file)
Check performed: opened ALL usecase methods, counted error returns vs doc rows.
- docs/api/consent/accept-consent.md
  - Usecase `Create()` has 5 error returns, doc has 3 error rows — MISSING:
    - `ErrPurposeExpired` → should be 422
    - `fmt.Errorf("send notification: %w", err)` → should be 500
  - Handler bind error (400) not documented

### Index Integrity
- TOC link to `consent/revoke-consent.md` → file exists: ✅/❌
- Group "purpose" listed in index but directory is empty

### Summary
| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Groups in code | X |
| Groups in docs | Y |
| Endpoints in code | X |
| Endpoint files in docs | Y |
| Missing files | Z |
| Orphan files | W |
| Field mismatches | N |
| Error response mismatches | E |
| Broken index links | P |
```

### Step 4: Verify (mandatory after every Generate/Update)

Every time you create or modify files in `docs/api/`, run a full verification pass before reporting completion. This catches drift between the docs you just wrote and the actual code. Skipping this step means silent errors ship.

Run **every item** in the [Verification Checklist](references/api-doc-template.md#verification-checklist) at the same depth as Step 2 — re-open the actual struct source files and ALL usecase methods, do not check from memory.

**Fix or report:**

- If mismatches are found → fix the doc immediately, then re-run the checklist to confirm the fix
- If all checks pass → proceed to output
- Maximum 2 fix-and-recheck cycles. If issues persist after 2 rounds, report the remaining discrepancies in the output as warnings

## Expanding to Other Languages

This skill currently focuses on Go. The scanning logic is in `references/go-scan-patterns.md`. To add a new language:
1. Create `references/<language>-scan-patterns.md` with framework-specific route/handler patterns
2. Update Step 0 to detect the language from project files (`go.mod` → Go, `package.json` → Node.js, etc.)
3. The template and output format remain the same regardless of language

## Output

After completion, report:

```
